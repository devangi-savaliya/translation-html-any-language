This is Addon file for Sync post with other site
If you use this file, it works like this: when you create a new post in the source domain in English, the post is automatically translated into the language you selected inside the source domain for the target domain. The target domain will receive the post in the chosen language, such as Italian, Spanish, German, or whichever you specify during the setup process. The source domain remains in English, while the translation happens seamlessly for the target domains.
